Resident Evil 4 is one of the most popular and influential games in the survival horror genre. It was released in 2005 for the GameCube and PlayStation 2, and later ported to other platforms, including the PC. The game follows Leon S. Kennedy, a former police officer and special agent, who is sent to a rural area of Spain to rescue the U.S. president's daughter, Ashley Graham, from a cult that has infected the villagers with a mind-controlling parasite. The game features a third-person perspective, over-the-shoulder camera, and action-oriented gameplay that combines shooting, melee combat, and quick-time events.
 
The PC version of Resident Evil 4 was criticized for its poor graphics and sound quality, as well as its lack of mouse support and other features that were present in the console versions. The HD Movie and Cut-Scenes Patch is one of the many fan-made mods that aim to improve the PC version of the game and make it more enjoyable for modern players. The patch replaces the low-resolution movies and cut-scenes with higher-quality ones that match the original game's style and atmosphere. The patch also offers a Turbo option that increases the game's speed and reduces the loading times, making the game more responsive and smooth.
